    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> docker build -t \"cfe-redis\" .\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Personally, I like adding commands like `docker build -t \"cfe-redis\" .` to a `build.ps1` file so I can just call `./build.ps1` if I ever want to build it again in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "> docker run -it --rm -p 6379:6379 \"cfe-redis\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple things to note:\n",

    "`-p 6379:6379` is exposing the port `6379` on our local system AND in our docker container. \n",
    "\n",
    "`cfe-redis` is merely the tag name of the image we created in the build process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Just like with `build.ps1`, make a `run.ps1` file containing `docker run -it --rm -p 6379:6379 \"cfe-redis\"` as a shortcut to running this container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify Docker connection\n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux and Mac, you can just run `redis-cli ping` but, since we're using docker, we don't have the `redis-cli` command available on our system. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need another way to test. Since I use `redis` in my [Python](https://cfe.sh/t/python) projects, I'll create a simple python program to ensure our non-container items can connect to `redis`. \n",
