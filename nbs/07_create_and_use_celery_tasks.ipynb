    "#  Create & Use Celery Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Celery Tasks are functions that can be either (1) normal blocking python execution or (2) delayed non-blocking execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Normal, blocking, execution**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def hello_world(num=1):\n",
    "    time.sleep(num)\n",
    "    print(f\"hello world {num}\")\n",

    "hello_world(num=1)\n",
    "hello_world(num=2)\n",
    "hello_world(num=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "I would imagine you know blocking execution really well by now. The above function is an example of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delayed non-blocking execution**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "# shared_task is ideal for Django\n",
    "from celery import shared_task\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@shared_task\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the important things to note about the above code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@shared_task` this decorator is so celery knows about this task. We'll have a real example below. \n",
    "- `.delay()` since the `@shared_task` decorator is implemented on the `hello_world` function, we can call this method. This is how we \"delay\" the execution of this function. This will run as soon as soon as the Celery worker can (we'll implement this more later.\n",
    "- `.apply_async()`: `.delay()` is actually a shortcut to `apply_async`. We have a lot more control over execution using `apply_async`. \n",

    "## Call Tasks Cheat Sheet\n",
    "These are pulled directly from the [docs](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/calling.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `T.delay(arg, kwarg=value)`: Star arguments shortcut to `.apply_async`. (`.delay(*args, **kwargs)` calls `.apply_async(args, kwargs)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `T.apply_async((arg,), {'kwarg': value})`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `T.apply_async(countdown=10)`: executes in 10 seconds from now.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `T.apply_async(eta=now + timedelta(seconds=10))`: executes in 10 seconds from now, specified using eta\n",
    "\n",
    "- `T.apply_async(countdown=60, expires=120)`: executes in one minute from now, but expires after 2 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `T.apply_async(expires=now + timedelta(days=2))`: expires in 2 days, set using datetime.\n",
